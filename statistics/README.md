## Sampling:
* Cross-sectional sample
* Sampling across time

### Sampling Sins:
* Bias: Sample has to be representative of the population. If the sampling method is biased, the results cannot be extrapolated to the population. 
* Noise: Even for a representative sample, the results will have statistical error or noise that can muddy conclusions. 

### Data Descriptives:
* Measures of Location: Identify number or numbers around which data is centered. 
* Measures of Dispersion: How much divergence there is on a data item, across a sample.
* Measure of Skewness: How symmetric or asymmetric the data is around a central value. 

### Distributions:
* Discrete or Continuous 
* Symmetric or Asymmetric
